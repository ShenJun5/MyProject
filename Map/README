### Map

This is a web map project which uses Folium library.

It has 2 layers:
one layer of all the volcanoes in United States -- all marked with its elevation & differentiate with color based on elevation;
and one layer of the population in every country -- color is also used to differentiate the different population group.

It also has a LayerControl panel on the upper right which you can turn off/on either layer.
